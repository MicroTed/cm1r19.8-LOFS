             ***2020-01-29 Thoughts before applying LOFS mods to r19.8***

I already did LOFS patches to r19.5 a little over a year ago. However, that was before I
fixed some sticky shit in r16. I abandoned r19.5 once I couldn't use it because of the
pressure explosion bug (that George just fixed for r19.8, yay). So while it is useful to
see the approach I took to r19.5 I can't just duplicate it exactly. It looks like r19.5
and r19.8 do not have major structural differences, he just mostly added functionality.

I found the sweary parts of r16 where I finally get rid of the truncation error problems
with file names and also the bug where I'd lose a single output file when the model
croaked and then re-running from restarts. I will make sure this functionality carries
over (making sure I flush files to disk at the proper time is key). Also want immediate
flush when time_levels_per_hist_file is set to 1.

For truncation issues, initial thought is to just make dtl (what is read from the
namelist.input file) double precision. Not sure why George keeps it single precision.
Grepping through the code this shouldn't break stuff since he uses double precision for
all of the other time variables. That way I won't have to have dbl_dt_orf or whatever!!

Restarts: I'm still just going to do the dumb restart approach for now, organizing HDF5
files (just array dumps, really) into directories and using gzip compression. I do not
think anyone who uses this version of CM1 would do DA work and a lot of the complexity
with restarts stems from George making CM1 easier to use for DA folks.

There are a whole lot more diagnostics that can be output, that will be easy just time
consuming to add. Also we need to add zfp compression parameters for all of them. I'm
thinking to multiply all of the forcing terms by a thousand or a million. I hate tiny
floating point numbers.
